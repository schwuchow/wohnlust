# Wohnlust
A fictive real estate firm's minimalist website offering affordable accommodations for single, sociable people.

## Motivation - Product
The current housing market harms basic needs of affordable, enjoyable homes. Wohnlust tries to approach this issue by offering a shared living environment with private space.

## Motivation - Tech
This website is built with a MERN stack. The main focus is the React & Redux frontend where I wanted to learn theirs main concepts and tried out different interactions/animations. The frontend connects to a basic Express backend from which it gets the manually created accomodations saved in the MongoDB Atlas cloud.

## Current status
Still has a lot of small things to be improved.
